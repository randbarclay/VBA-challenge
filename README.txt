Notes:

multiple_year_stock_data is the workbook after successful running of the macro

multiple_year_stock_data_blank is the workbook prior to running the macro. run the macro to see formatting!

i took screenshots but not of the full table...that felt excessive to me. i don't have snag-it or another screen capture software that 
can capture a scrolling window. and i didn't want to take 8 screenshots each year
